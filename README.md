Mathematics in the SAT
======================

Here comes a couple of tips and tricks when studying for the Mathematics sections of the [SAT](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/) exam.

The Importance of Algebra
-------------------------

First, let us head over [here](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/math/types) to check out the types of Mathematics tested. (You should check out the [official test prep materials](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/practice-preparation) as well. They go into more details than the web page above.) Currently, they are classified into
 * Heart of Algebra
 * Problem Solving and Data Analysis
 * Passport to Advanced Math
 * Additional Topics in Math

However, there is only one Mathematics and its purpose is to **model reality**.
In fact, the goal of the SAT should be to measure your ability to apply Mathematical tools in solving problems, which is an (arguably) good indicator of college success.

If you check out the above subtopics, you will see that **equations** appear throughout.
Let me stress: **Algebra**, the study of _equations_ and _inequalities_, **is the core of the SAT**.
It can be used to solve problems in other topics such as data analysis, statistics, etc.

The SAT is about giving you equations and inequalities without explicitly doing so. To do so, the test maker draws inspiration from
 * Daily life:
 * Ratio, percentage, percent change:
 * Statistics:
 * Science:
 * Advanced Maths (polynomial):

Key Algebra Skills
------------------

Algebra in the SAT essentially has 3 concepts, each with a couple of important skills:
 * Expressions
    - Evaluate
    - Simplify
 * Equations
    - Manipulate, simplify
    - Solve
 * Inequalities
    - Solve
    - Manipulate, simplify

Relationship between Algebra and Graph
--------------------------------------

A fairly common theme in the SAT is the interaction between
 * _Algebra_: Equations, Inequalities, ...
 * _Graph_: Intercepts, vertex, axis of symmetry, ...

A common type of questions is to give you some information on one side (e.g. algebra) and ask you about the information on the other side (e.g. graph).

Here are some examples of a Graph => Algebra question:
 * What is the equation of the line passing through the origin and is perpendicular to the line y = 2x - 1?
 * Write the equation of the parabola having the vertex at (-1, 1) and one x-intercept is 3.
 * Given the graph of y = f(x) where f(x) = x<sup>3</sup> - x + 1. How many solutions does the equation f(x) = x has?

Here is an example of Algebra => Graph question:
 * What is the radius of the circle given by the equation x<sup>2</sup> - 2x + y<sup>2</sup> - 4x - 5 = 0?
 * Given a &lt; 0 and b, c &gt; 0. Which of the following could be the graph of y = a(x - b)<sup>2</sup> + c?

Here is a real question:

So it is a good idea to keep a picture corresponding the algebra and graph.
